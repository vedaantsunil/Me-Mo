An Android Studio App Which Helps You Keep A Track Of Things That Are Truly Important To You

Given this global pandemic situation, time management is the core issue people tend to deal with. People 
are compelled to work or attend college from home. But while working from home people do tend to lose 
focus and eventually lose track of time. 
This is where our app comes into play, it will notify the user about 
chores throughout the day like medications, sending mails, making an appointment, meeting or lecture 
timings and links. 
This will help the user to complete all their tasks on time.
